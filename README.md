#Blackjack Advisor

##Description

This program provides a user with the "winningest" strategy for a given two-card blackjack hand. Based on your two cards and the dealer's face-up card, you'll get advice on whether to "Hit", "Split", "Double", or "Stand".

##Instructions

1. When prompted, enter each of your two dealt cards. 
2. Enter the dealer's face-up card.
3. Follow the advice provided to win big money!

Have fun!


####Disclaimer!
I did not calculate the strategy on my own! Instead I borrowed from [this website](http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/calculator/).

Also...I refuse responsibility for any losses you may sustain in Atlantic City while using this program.

####Limitations
Unfortunately, the program does not provide any further strategy if you "hit" after the initial two-card hand.
