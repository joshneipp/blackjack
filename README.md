#Blackjack Advisor

##Description

This program provides a user with the "winningest" strategy for a given two-card blackjack hand.

##Instructions

1. When prompted, enter each of your two dealt cards. 
2. Enter the dealer's face-up card.
3. Win big money!



I did not calculate the strategy on my own! Instead I borrowed from [this website](http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/calculator/).


###Limitations
Unfortunately, the program does not provide strategy for any dealt cards after the two initial cards.
