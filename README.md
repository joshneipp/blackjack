#Blackjack Advisor

##Description

2. Enter the dealer's face-up card.

Have fun!


####Disclaimer!
I did not calculate the strategy on my own! Instead I borrowed from [this website](http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/calculator/).

Also...I refuse responsibility for any losses you may sustain at Atlantic City while using this program.

####Limitations
Unfortunately, the program does not provide any further strategy if you "hit" after the initial two-card hand.
